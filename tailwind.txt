The snippet [&>*]:flex is a Tailwind CSS group selector that applies the flex utility class to all direct children (*) of a parent element.

Let's break it down:
[&>:

This is a special syntax introduced by Tailwind's arbitrary variants.
The & refers to the current element where this style is applied.
> means direct children selector in CSS.
*:

This is the universal selector in CSS, which matches all elements.
:flex:

The :flex is a Tailwind utility that applies the CSS property display: flex; to the matched elements.
What it does:
When you apply [&>*]:flex to a parent element, all its direct children will automatically have display: flex applied.

Example:
html
Copy
Edit
<div class="[&>*]:flex">
  <div>Child 1</div>
  <div>Child 2</div>
  <div>Child 3</div>
</div>
Result:
The div with [&>*]:flex will ensure that each child element (<div>) is set to display: flex.
This approach is useful for applying styles to direct children without modifying them individually or adding extra classes.
